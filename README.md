This is an example of extracting facial action representations from facial images.

Usage

(1) Using the OpenFace toolkit to process facial images, it's worth noting that we've modified the default parameters when in use, setting the 'img_size' to 128 and 'simscale' to 0.62.

(2) The currently provided models are trained on images of size 64. In the "extract_feature.py" file, we provide an example of how to extract image features.
